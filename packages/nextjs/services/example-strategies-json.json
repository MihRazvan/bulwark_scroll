Next, we borrow USDQ against the supplied USDC with an interest rate of 10% and receive 0.0005 USDQ. To offset the borrowing cost, we deposit the borrowed USDQ into the stability pool on Quill Finance, where it can earn a yield of 10%. This strategy focuses on low-risk activities with minimal volatility, aiming for steady growth over time within the 2-5% APY range.",

The borrowed USDQ is provided to the Quill stability pool, which generates substantial returns from liquidations and interest.
