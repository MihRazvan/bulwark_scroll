Bulwark is an AI-powered decentralized finance (DeFi) strategy optimizer built specifically for the Scroll blockchain network. Scroll is a zkEVM-based Ethereum Layer 2 solution that offers enhanced scalability, fast transaction speeds, and significantly lower transaction costs compared to Ethereum's mainnet.

Bulwark’s core objective is to simplify and democratize strategic DeFi asset management, enabling users—whether beginners or experienced crypto investors—to effortlessly access optimized DeFi strategies. The platform automatically analyzes a user’s cryptocurrency wallet, evaluates current market conditions, assesses risk exposure, and generates tailored asset allocation strategies.

Main Components and Features of Bulwark:

1. Portfolio Analysis
Wallet Analysis: Automatically identifies token balances (ETH, USDC, SRC, and others) and existing positions within user wallets.
Multi-Protocol Position Detection: Scans and detects active lending, borrowing, liquidity providing (LP), and other DeFi positions across supported protocols (AAVE V3, Ambient DEX, and Quill Finance).
Risk Exposure Assessment: Calculates key risk metrics such as collateral risks, liquidation thresholds, health factors, and correlation risks across active positions.
Historical Performance Tracking: Planned feature to provide comprehensive historical analytics on past performance, yields, and ROI.
2. Strategy Generation and Risk Categorization
Uses an internal AI model powered by OpenAI's GPT technology to generate optimized DeFi strategies.
Offers five distinct risk categories to suit different investor profiles:
Anchor Strategy (Risk Level 1): Highly conservative, prioritizes stablecoin-based yields and minimal exposure to volatility.
Zenith Strategy: Balanced approach optimizing risk-to-reward ratio, moderate leveraging and diversification across protocols.
Wildcard Strategy: Highly aggressive approach involving high leverage, frequent trading and arbitrage across DeFi platforms to potentially maximize returns at the cost of higher risk.
3. Multi-Protocol Routing and Execution
Automatically evaluates best yield opportunities across multiple integrated DeFi protocols:

AAVE v3: Lending and borrowing ETH, USDC, SRC and other tokens. Bulwark utilizes AAVE’s health factor and liquidation thresholds for advanced risk management.
Ambient DEX (CrocSwap): Handles token swaps, liquidity provision, real-time pool liquidity analysis, swap price impacts, and optimal token exchange rates.
Quill Finance: Allows users to borrow stablecoins (USDQ) against collateral such as ETH and SRC. Includes detailed collateral management, liquidation avoidance strategies, and interaction with stability pools.
Intelligent routing ensures optimal returns and minimal gas fees by automatically determining the most efficient pathways through these protocols.

4. Rebalancing Logic
Proactively tracks market conditions in real-time, adjusting strategies automatically when specific parameters or risk thresholds are breached.
Sends real-time user notifications recommending portfolio adjustments and rebalancing opportunities.
5. User Interface
Strategy Visualization: Provides clear, intuitive visual flow diagrams representing token flow across multiple DeFi platforms (AAVE, Ambient, Quill).
Risk Visualization: Color-codes all recommended strategy steps and pathways by risk severity—green for low risk, amber for moderate, red for high risk.
APY & Return Projections: Clearly displays projected annual percentage yields (APYs), returns, and expected performance for all recommended strategies.
5. AI-Powered Governance Assistant (Planned)
Bulwark also plans to integrate an AI-powered Governance Assistant chatbot that will provide services such as:

Governance proposal impact analysis
Help drafting governance proposals
Governance vote delegation assistance
Simulation of governance outcomes
Treasury visualization
Direct action integration (execute votes and delegations through the chatbot interface)
